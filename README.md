# GraphTheoryWithWiresharkAndOthers

This is the start of my cybersecurity and graph theory journey. Over the next 282 days, I will be applying various graph theory concepts with WireShark and others.
The goal is to have a new algorithm, feature, or application to the people when I can. Hopefully you learn along the way as well. Have a great trip!
